# Part 4: Review of Techincal Analysis

**Definition**<br>
Technical analysis is a method of scrutinity applied to stocks that evalutes how supply and demand of a stock affects changes in the price, volume, and implied volatility. This method applies past trading activity and price changes as indicators for future price movments. This is done through charting trading signals for a given stock as a marker for action. Some popluar indicators used for this approarch include trendlines, channels, moving averages, and momentum. General assumptions that this method operates on for success are as follows, the market discounts everything, prices follow a past trend, and history tends to repeat itself.

**Advantages**<br>
Inceased likihood of profitable trading can occur by following a indicators and trends that are charted in a stock. The charting task provides signals of entry or exit in a position that can lead to a profitable trade. Another clear advantage is risk managment. Technical analysis helps manage risk by letting traders use a security's technical details to set stop-loss orders, cutting down on potential losses. It also keeps emotions out of trading by focusing on things like chart patterns and indicators, leading to smarter choices. Additionally, this approach works for any security with past trading data, making it a handy tool for all kinds of portfolios.

**Drawbacks**<br>
Critics argue that technical analysis is flawed because it conflicts with the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which suggests historical price data contains no actionable information, and because market history does not repeat exactly, rendering price pattern study unreliable and prices better modeled as a random walk, while its apparent success in some cases may simply be due to self-fulfilling prophecies where collective trader actions based on technical signals temporarily cause the predicted price movements. For example, If a large number of traders have place a stop-loss order at a certain indicator and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock price down, confirming the movement traders anticipated.

**Notes on Term Project Application**
I do not see a strong use case for this approach within the term project. This analysis requires charting tools to identify indicators for stocks of interest. Using this within a knowledge graph could introduce significant complexity and time to input daily stock moments. More research would have to be done on its viability but the best way I could see this working is if a service was found that automates the charting to get a large amount of data moved into the knowledge graph.
