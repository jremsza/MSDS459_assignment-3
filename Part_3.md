# Part 3: Review of Fundamental Analysis

**Definition**<br>
Fundamental analysis is an investment research approach that aims to uncover how much a company is really worth. Using this analysis to answer that question can help decide if the current stock price is undervalued or overvalued in the market. Taking a stringent look at a company's balance sheet can reveal insights into a company's true worth.

**Advantages**
The advantages of fundamental analysis helps quantify a company's value and shares by examining financial statements for profitability, liquidity, and stability, alongside assessing management, competitive advantages, and industry trends to guide investment decisions over the long term. It aids in identifying undervalued companies based on their growth potential and helps spot red flags or overvalued investments by revealing financial health and market position, which is crucial for avoiding underperformance or downturns.

**Drawbacks**
Fundamental analysis can be quite time-consuming, requiring investors to delve deeply into a company's financial statements, management, competitive landscape, and industry trends, which can be a significant commitment for individual retail investors especially those with limited experience. Furthermore, it's not a one-time task; investors must continuously stay updated on company news, economic shifts, and industry developments that could impact the initial analysis. Finally, effectively performing fundamental analysis requires specific technical knowledge to correctly interpret complex financial statements and understand valuation metrics, and even then, accurately timing market entry and exit points based on this analysis remains challenging

**Notes on Term Project Application**
I do not see a strong use case for this approach within the term project. Since this analysis often starts at the company level, followed by the industry, and then the assessment of various macroeconomic factors, using this within a knowledge graph could introduce significant complexity and potentially become unmanageable. While the initial conceptualization might include various economic indicators, I would narrow the scope to ensure a focused implementation. I would recommend concentrating on the latter two identified areas: industry-specific dynamics and broader macroeconomic conditions. By adopting this more focused approach, the individual nodes within the knowledge graph can represent key elements within these domains, facilitating a more controlled and insightful analysis. For instance, within the healthcare industry domain, nodes could represent specific companies, products, or supply chain components, along with their interrelationships. Similarly, within the macroeconomic domain, nodes could represent key indicators such as inflation rates, interest rates, unemployment figures, and overall economic growth trends, and their impact on the identified industries. This deliberate limitation of scope will enhance the clarity and maintainability of the knowledge graph.
